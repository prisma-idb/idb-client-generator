Replace `writeSqlSchemaWithSync` with `sqlContractWithSync`, a file-free version of the same transform: it decomposes the SQL family's `prismaContract()` into its component parts and substitutes an in-memory `load()`, so the sync `Changelog` model can be injected into a real server schema without ever writing a generated `.prisma` file to disk (see [prisma/orm#30115](https://github.com/prisma/orm/issues/30115)). It needs the core `defineConfig` wired by hand rather than a target's convenience wrapper (which only accepts a schema path for `contract`) — see the README for the full example.

**Breaking:** `writeSqlSchemaWithSync` is removed. Pre-1.0, so this ships as a minor bump rather than major.
