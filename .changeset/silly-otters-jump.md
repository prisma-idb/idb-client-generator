Initial release. Browser-side outbox sync extension for the Prisma Next IDB family: wraps an IDB ORM client to atomically write outbox events alongside every mutation, then provides a `SyncWorker` that pushes those events to a server and pulls remote changes back, plus a managed IDB client for singleton/race-safe access and retryable outbox event handling with `localChangePending` tracking.

This package previously shipped with no test coverage. Its first suite (unit + real-browser multi-tab Playwright) surfaced and fixed three bugs that were live in the previous unreleased build: relation traversal always threw, the push query built an invalid boolean `IDBKeyRange`, and pull unconditionally skipped every log entry.
