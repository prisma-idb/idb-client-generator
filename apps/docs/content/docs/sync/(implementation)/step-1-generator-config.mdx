## Step 1: Configure the Generator

Before implementing sync, you need to configure the Prisma IDB generator in your `schema.prisma` file. This tells the generator which models to sync and how to scope the data.

### Configuration Options

Add the generator block to your `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
generator prismaIDB {
  provider = "idb-client-generator"
  output   = "./prisma-idb"

  // Enable sync capabilities
  outboxSync = true

  // Anchor model for the ownership DAG
  rootModel  = "User"

  // Models to exclude from sync (optional)
  exclude    = ["Session", "Verification", "Account", "ChangeLog"]
}
```

### Required Settings

- **`outboxSync = true`**: Enables the bidirectional sync engine. Without this, the generated client will be read-only.
- **`rootModel`**: The primary entity that acts as the anchor for all other models. This must be a model in your schema that represents the data owner (typically `User`).

### Optional Settings

- **`exclude`**: Array of model names to skip during client generation. Use this for:
  - Authentication models (`Session`, `Account`, `Verification`)
  - Changelog models (excluded automatically, but good practice to list explicitly)
  - Server-only models that shouldn't be synced to clients
  - Large or temporary tables

### Scoping Rules

The `rootModel` and `exclude` settings work together to define which data gets synced:

- Only the `rootModel` and its descendants (models that reference it, directly or indirectly) are synced
- Excluded models are never generated in the client
- The generated client only syncs data relevant to the current user (scoped by `rootModel`)

### Example: Multi-User Blog

```prisma
model User {
  id    String @id @default(cuid())
  email String @unique
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id     String @id @default(cuid())
  title  String
  userId String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

generator prismaIDB {
  provider   = "idb-client-generator"
  output     = "./prisma-idb"
  outboxSync = true
  rootModel  = "User"
  exclude    = ["ChangeLog", "AuditLog"]
}
```

In this setup:

- `User` is the root model
- `Post` syncs because it references `User`
- `AuditLog` is excluded and won't appear in the client

### Next Steps

After configuring the generator, you need to:

1. Add the `ChangeLog` table to your schema
2. Implement the push endpoint
3. Implement the pull endpoint
4. Initialize the sync worker on the client
