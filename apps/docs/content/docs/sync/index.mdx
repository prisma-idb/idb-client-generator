## Prisma IDB Sync

The Prisma IDB Sync Engine is an optional component that enables bidirectional synchronization between the local IndexedDB database and a remote server. It is designed to ensure data consistency across multiple devices while providing robust conflict resolution and authorization mechanisms.

### Best Practices

It is highly recommended to thoroughly review the [Schema Requirements](./sync/schema-requirements) and [Authoritative Schema DAG](./sync/authoritative-schema-dag) guides to ensure your Prisma schema is properly structured for synchronization. Adhering to these guidelines will help you leverage the full capabilities of the Prisma IDB Sync Engine effectively.
