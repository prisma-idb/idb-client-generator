## Prisma IDB Sync

The Prisma IDB Sync Engine is an optional component that enables bidirectional synchronization between the local IndexedDB database and a remote server. It is designed to ensure data consistency across multiple devices while providing robust conflict resolution and authorization mechanisms.

### Best Practices

It is highly recommended to thoroughly review the [Schema Requirements](./sync/schema-requirements) and [Authoritative Schema DAG](./sync/authoritative-schema-dag) guides to ensure your Prisma schema is properly structured for synchronization. Adhering to these guidelines will help you leverage the full capabilities of the Prisma IDB Sync Engine effectively.

## Explore the Example

To see the Prisma IDB Sync Engine in action, check out the **pidb-kanban-example** application:

- **Repository**: Browse the [complete source code](https://github.com/prisma-idb/idb-client-generator/tree/main/apps/pidb-kanban-example) on GitHub to understand how the sync system is integrated into a real application
- **Live Demo**: Try the [interactive kanban board](https://pidb-kanban-example.vercel.app/) to experience bidirectional synchronization in action

The kanban example demonstrates real-world sync patterns including conflict resolution, offline support, and multi-device synchronization.
