## Prisma IndexedDB Client Generator

A **Prisma generator** that creates a familiar, type-safe client for IndexedDB with optional **bidirectional synchronization** to a remote server. Define your data model once in Prisma schema, and get both a local-first IndexedDB client and a complete sync engine built for conflict resolution and authorization.

### Core Features

- **Prisma-like API**: Use the syntax you already know. CRUD operations feel exactly like Prisma Client.
- **Type Safety**: Fully typed operations generated directly from your Prisma schema.
- **Local-First**: All data lives in IndexedDB. Works offline, syncs when ready.

### Sync Features

- **Optional Sync Engine**: Bidirectional sync with authoritative DAG-based conflict resolution.
- **Authorization & Ownership**: Built-in ownership invariants ensure users can only modify their data.
- **Outbox Pattern**: Reliable push operations with automatic retry and batch support.
- **Changelog Materialization**: Efficient pull operations that materialize server state for clients.

Learn more about sync in the [Synchronization section](./docs/sync).
